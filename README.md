So this is not a script originally created from me (idk who made it), but here is what I've done to it:
- Added a lot of new object ESPs (and will continue doing so as far as I'm playing GTA V).
- Reduced source code (removed all hard-codded default colorisations, and maybe more that I've forgot about).
- Source code now uses named hashes instead of hex hashes. That's way cleaner and easier to read/maintain like that.

I used tabulations characters in the source code because the og script uses them but idk it looks ugly in GitHub, personally in VS Code it's pretty. lmfao
